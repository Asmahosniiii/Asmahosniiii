# Asma Hosni | Data Analyst |  Turning complex data sets into valuable insights

Hello everyone!ðŸ‘‹

As a data analysis enthusiast, Iâ€™m always looking for opportunities to apply my skills to real-world problems.

 I am experienced in data visualization techniques and tools; 
 
 I use data visualization to bring the numbers to life and share the insights with others, I create interactive dashboards and reports using tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Excel. histograms, Bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and heat maps are some of the visualization types I have designed.

I rely on are regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and data mining. These techniques allow me to uncover insights and predict outcomes from data.

I am highly organized, with great attention to detail, flexible, a fast learner and enthusiastic about learning new things.

I hope this glimpse into my world of data analysis has sparked your interest in the potential that data holds. The future is data-driven, and I'm ready to dive in!

Feel Free to contact me!
